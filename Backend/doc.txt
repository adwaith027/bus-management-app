What Django does at startup

You run:
python manage.py runserver

Django:
Loads settings.py
Reads INSTALLED_APPS

For each app in INSTALLED_APPS:
Django loads its AppConfig (from apps.py)
Creates an instance of that AppConfig

After all apps are loaded:
Django calls app_config.ready() once per app

You should not put irreversible logic there !!!!

apps.py exists to run app-level startup code when Django loads an app.

Django starts
Django loads each app’s AppConfig
AppConfig.ready() is called
Inside ready() we import signals
Importing signals registers all signal handlers

So the purpose is : Force-load code that must run once at startup  !!!
